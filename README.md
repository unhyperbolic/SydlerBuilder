A program to build polyhedra described by Sydler, see http://www.unhyperbolic.org/sydler.html for an example.

Requires python3 with PyQt5 (QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtOpenGL) and OpenGL (GL and GLU).
It is probably easiest to use anaconda to install these dependencies.

Use as

python3 sydlerBuilder.py sydlerFundamental.py

The code in the right window is evaluated to create the polyhedra shown in the left window.
Left click on left window to pan. Ctrl-left click on a point on a polyhedron to frame it.
